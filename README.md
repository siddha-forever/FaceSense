# FaceSense
This project uses OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (DNN) module to detect faces in real-time from images or webcam video and predict the age and gender of detected faces. The models for face detection, age prediction, and gender prediction are pretrained and loaded from files.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV DNN.
- Age and gender prediction based on detected faces.
- Works with both images and webcam video feeds.
- Overlays bounding boxes and labels for detected faces with age and gender predictions.
